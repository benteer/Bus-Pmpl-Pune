The search results do not contain a complete README.md file for creating a PMPML bus app in ReactJS. However, they provide some relevant information that could be included in such a README:
The Pune Local Bus Guide app shows bus routes, live timings, fares, and PMPML bus details for Pune. This demonstrates the key features a PMPML bus app should have.
A GitHub project called "1040_PMTBusApp" aims to help users easily get the bus schedule in Pune. This indicates there is interest in creating such an app.
Pune NGO Parisar is installing interactive screens at PMPML bus depots to preview how a PMPML app will work, as the official app launch has been delayed. This highlights the need for and interest in a PMPML bus app.
The official PMPML website has some bus route and schedule information, which could be incorporated into a ReactJS app.

To create a complete README.md for a PMPML bus app in ReactJS, you would need to provide instructions on setting up the development environment, installing required dependencies, integrating with PMPML's data sources, implementing key features like route search and live tracking, testing, and deployment. You could reference similar open-source transit apps for inspiration.
